# Nest React CRUD App

A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built with React and NestJS, using TypeORM and PostgreSQL.

## Introduction

This project is a basic CRUD application that demonstrates the integration of NestJS with PostgreSQL for backend services and React for the user interface. The goal is to render data from a PostgreSQL database into our React UI.

### Tutorial Source

The project is based on the tutorial available at [Medium - NestJS and PostgreSQL: A CRUD Tutorial](https://medium.com/simform-engineering/nestjs-and-postgresql-a-crud-tutorial-32aa78778752). Feel free to refer to the tutorial for more in-depth explanations.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new items to the database.
- **Read:** Fetch and display data from the PostgreSQL database.
- **Update:** Modify existing data.
- **Delete:** Remove items from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS:** A powerful Node.js framework for building server-side applications.
- **TypeScript:** Used throughout the entire application for enhanced type safety.
- **PostgreSQL:** Our relational database for storing and managing data.
- **React:** The user interface framework for building dynamic web applications.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Under Development:** This project is currently under development. While the basic CRUD functionalities are in place, additional features and improvements are planned.

### Current Status

At the moment, the React app renders a list of user names fetched from the backend. Further enhancements and features will be added as the project progresses.
